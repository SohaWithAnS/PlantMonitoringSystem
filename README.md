# PlantMonitoringSystem
The project I did for my 'Internet of Things' course. It detects the level of soil moisture using a soil moisture sensor, measures the temperature at regular intervals and sends an email to the authorised plant owner with a photo of the plant when the soil moisture is less than adequate.
